# Project Status: Semantic Kernel Multi-Agent Application

## Completed Tasks

1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Created all necessary Azure resources including:
     - Resource Group
     - Azure OpenAI Service
     - Model Deployment (gpt-35-turbo)
     - Azure AI Foundry Hub
     - Azure AI Foundry Project
   - Connected Azure OpenAI to Azure AI Foundry through the portal
   - Verified connectivity to all services

2. **Weather Service Implementation**
   - Implemented National Weather Service integration (no API key required)
   - Successfully tested real-time US weather data retrieval
   - Added error handling for non-US locations

3. **Code Structure**
   - Created a well-organized project structure
   - Implemented modular components for agents, services, and utilities
   - Added configuration management with environment variables
   - Developed testing scripts for key components

4. **Agent Deployment Implementation**
   - Created deployment scripts using multiple methods:
     - Using Semantic Kernel SDK (deploy_agents.py)
     - Using direct REST API calls (deploy_rest.py)
     - Using Service Principal authentication (deploy_with_service_principal.py)
     - Using Azure OpenAI Assistants API (deploy_openai_assistants.py)
   - Added interactive chat client for deployed agents (interact_deployed_agents.py)

5. **Successful Deployment**
   - Successfully deployed Chat Agent and Weather Agent using Azure OpenAI Assistants API
   - Used API version 2024-05-01-preview to ensure compatibility
   - Agents deployed with IDs:
     - Chat Agent: asst_mlM7d4ziChBc3AeTpP10YQPI
     - Weather Agent: asst_qGrjdsmtfytNnYMli4vYAn2p

6. **Agent Orchestration**
   - Implemented a multi-agent orchestration system using Semantic Kernel 1.30.0
   - Created plugin registration using KernelPlugin.from_object()
   - Added function calling mechanism for weather query delegation
   - Developed a complete chat system with orchestrated delegation
   - Documented orchestration capabilities in detailed guides
   - Leveraged the stable Semantic Kernel SDK for reliable agent orchestration

## Current Status

1. **Deployment Solutions**
   - Successfully deployed agents using Azure OpenAI Assistants API
   - Identified API version 2024-05-01-preview as compatible with Assistants API
   - Created deployment scripts that reliably deploy both chat and weather agents
   - Earlier deployment challenges with Azure AI Agent Service have been resolved

2. **Authentication Solutions**
   - Successfully using API key authentication with Azure OpenAI
   - Identified and addressed token expiration issues with DefaultAzureCredential
   - Resolved compatibility issues with service endpoints
   
3. **Working Solutions**
   - Deployed agents on Azure OpenAI are fully functional
   - Local agent functionality works correctly
   - Weather Service implementation is complete and tested
   - Agent orchestration system is working correctly using Semantic Kernel
   - Function calling for specialized task delegation is operational
   - Implementation leverages the stable Semantic Kernel SDK (version 1.30.0) without requiring workarounds for SDK instability - any compatibility issues are addressed through proper API usage

## Next Steps

1. **Orchestration Enhancements**
   - Add more specialized agents beyond weather (e.g., calendar, news)
   - Implement more complex orchestration patterns
   - Add memory capabilities for context retention
   - Create a unified UI for interacting with orchestrated agents

2. **Plugin Extensions**
   - Extend the Weather plugin with more capabilities
   - Add new plugins for other domains
   - Implement plugin discovery for dynamic orchestration
   - Create a framework for easily adding new plugins

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Add better error handling in chat interfaces
   - Implement conversation history management
   - Create usage examples and tutorials
   - Develop a web-based interface for the orchestration system

## Using the Current Code

1. **Setup Azure Services**
   ```bash
   bash src/scripts/setup_azure_infrastructure.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy Agents to Azure OpenAI**
   ```bash
   python src/scripts/deploy_openai_assistants.py
   ```
   This script will:
   - Connect to Azure OpenAI
   - Create Chat and Weather agents
   - Save deployment information for later use

3. **Run the Orchestration System**
   ```bash
   python src/scripts/orchestrate_with_kernel.py
   ```
   This provides:
   - An integrated chat experience
   - Automatic delegation of weather queries
   - Seamless response integration

4. **Test Local Functionality**
   ```bash
   python src/scripts/local_chat.py
   ```

5. **Interact with Deployed Agents**
   ```bash
   python src/scripts/interact_openai_assistants.py
   ```

6. **Test Weather Service**
   ```bash
   python src/scripts/test_weather_service.py
   ```
