# Semantic Kernel Multi-Agent Deployment Success

## Deployment Achievement

We have successfully deployed our multi-agent system to Azure using the Azure OpenAI Assistants API! This is a significant achievement that enables us to interact with specialized agents in the cloud.

## Key Discoveries

1. **API Version Compatibility**: 
   - The Azure OpenAI Assistants API is available in the following API versions:
     - 2024-03-01-preview
     - 2024-04-01-preview
     - 2024-05-01-preview
   - Earlier versions do not support the Assistants API

2. **Deployment Path**:
   - The correct deployment path is directly to Azure OpenAI (not Azure AI Agent Service)
   - Our OpenAI account supports the "assistants" capability as shown in its capabilities

3. **Authentication**:
   - Simple API key authentication works for the Assistants API
   - No need for complex token-based authentication

## Working Solution

Our solution consists of two key scripts:

1. **Deployment Script**: `src/scripts/deploy_openai_assistants.py`
   - Deploys both Chat and Weather agents
   - Uses the latest API version (2024-05-01-preview)
   - Creates assistants with specialized instructions
   - Saves deployment information to `deployment_info.json`

2. **Interaction Script**: `src/scripts/interact_openai_assistants.py`
   - Connects to the deployed assistants
   - Creates conversation threads
   - Enables interactive chat with both agents
   - Supports switching between agents

## Agent IDs

The deployment was successful and generated the following agent IDs:

- **Chat Agent**: `asst_mlM7d4ziChBc3AeTpP10YQPI`
- **Weather Agent**: `asst_qGrjdsmtfytNnYMli4vYAn2p`

## Usage Instructions

To interact with the deployed agents, run:

```bash
python3 src/scripts/interact_openai_assistants.py
```

In the interactive chat:
- Type messages to chat with the current agent
- Type `switch` to toggle between Chat and Weather agents
- Type `clear` to start a new conversation thread
- Type `exit` to quit

## Next Steps

Now that we have successfully deployed our agents, we can proceed with:

1. **Enhanced Functionality**:
   - Add function calling capabilities to the Weather Agent
   - Implement file upload/attachment features
   - Create an orchestrator agent that can delegate to specialized agents

2. **Integration**:
   - Connect the agents to external applications
   - Add webhook support for real-time notifications
   - Implement authentication for end users

3. **Monitoring and Analytics**:
   - Track agent usage and performance
   - Analyze conversation logs for improvement opportunities
   - Implement feedback collection from users

Congratulations on the successful deployment!
