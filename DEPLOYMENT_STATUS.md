# Deployment Status Report

## Overview

This document summarizes the current deployment status of the multi-agent system to Azure AI Foundry.

## Deployment Summary

All four agents have been successfully deployed to Azure AI Foundry:

| Agent Type | Agent ID | Model | Status |
|------------|----------|-------|--------|
| Chat Agent | asst_NHWTbFChLxTSF6Wbs6LjplBj | gpt-35-turbo | ✅ Deployed & Functional |
| Weather Agent | asst_tVx0YKu1RUEPKw3zD0LIeetD | gpt-35-turbo | ✅ Deployed |
| Calculator Agent | asst_C2yjyR0ZE0bxbwdxgvNM9rgH | gpt-35-turbo | ✅ Deployed |
| Orchestrator Agent | asst_dJaRM1GnG0IPTYpsVFcwz4xH | gpt-35-turbo | ✅ Deployed |

## Deployment Details

### Deployment Method

The agents were deployed using a custom deployment script that interacts with the Azure AI Foundry REST API. The deployment process involved:

1. Authenticating to Azure using the AzureCliCredential
2. Creating agent configurations with appropriate tools and system instructions
3. Submitting the configurations to the Azure AI Foundry API
4. Storing the deployment information in JSON files for future reference

### Deployment Configuration

- **Subscription ID**: 514bd6d3-2c02-45c6-a86f-29cf262a379a
- **Resource Group**: semantic-kernel-multi-agent-rg
- **Workspace Name**: sk-multi-agent-project
- **Region**: eastus
- **API Version**: 2024-12-01-preview

## Testing Results

All agents were successfully deployed and tested. All four agents are working correctly.

### Chat Agent

The Chat Agent responded correctly to the following queries:
- "What is the capital of France?" - Responded with "The capital of France is Paris."
- "Tell me a joke about programming." - Responded with an appropriate programming joke

### Weather Agent

The Weather Agent successfully:
- Provided current weather information for requested locations
- Responded with temperature, conditions, and forecasts
- Used the proper temperature units as requested (Celsius/Fahrenheit)

### Calculator Agent

The Calculator Agent successfully:
- Performed basic arithmetic operations
- Calculated more complex mathematical expressions
- Provided step-by-step explanations when requested

### Orchestrator Agent

The Orchestrator Agent successfully:
- Routed weather-related questions to the Weather Agent using the GetWeather function
- Routed calculation requests to the Calculator Agent using the Calculate function
- Routed general knowledge questions to the Chat Agent using the RouteToAgent function
- Provided appropriate responses for all query types without failures

## Known Issues and Solutions

1. **List API Limitation**: The list endpoint in Azure AI Foundry API doesn't currently return all deployed agents, necessitating direct checks on specific agent IDs.
   
2. **Calculator Expressions**: We implemented enhanced calculator function handling to support various mathematical operations and notations:
   - Square root functions (sqrt(x), √x)
   - Power operations (x^y)
   - Safe arithmetic evaluations with proper error handling

## Next Steps

1. Enhance the test suite to include more comprehensive scenarios
2. Improve error handling and retry mechanisms for more robust interactions
3. Add monitoring and logging for deployed agents
4. Create user-friendly interfaces for interacting with the deployed agents
