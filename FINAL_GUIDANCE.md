# Semantic Kernel Multi-Agent Application: Final Guidance

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented a multi-agent application using Semantic Kernel SDK, with:

1. **Local Agents**: Fully working chat and weather agents that run locally
2. **Weather Service**: A functional weather service using National Weather Service API
3. **Azure Infrastructure**: Properly provisioned Azure resources including:
   - OpenAI Account (sk-multi-agent-openai) with gpt-35-turbo deployment
   - Azure AI Hub (sk-multi-agent-hub)
   - Azure AI Project (sk-multi-agent-project)

## Deployment Options

For deploying agents to Azure AI Agent Service, you have the following options:

### Option 1: Manual Deployment through Azure Portal (Recommended)

The most reliable approach is to deploy agents manually through the Azure Portal:

1. Go to [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com)
2. Navigate to your project (sk-multi-agent-project)
3. Create two agents:
   - **ChatAgent**: A general-purpose assistant using the gpt-35-turbo model
   - **WeatherAgent**: A weather specialist agent using the gpt-35-turbo model
4. Configure the agents with the instructions provided in the deployment scripts

### Option 2: Programmatic Deployment

For programmatic deployment, we've provided multiple scripts:

#### Using Azure CLI

```bash
# Display available Azure resources
bash src/scripts/list_azure_resources.sh

# Attempt to deploy using Azure CLI REST API calls
bash src/scripts/deploy_agents_az_cli.sh
```

#### Using Azure SDK

```bash
# Find the correct endpoint URL
python3 src/scripts/find_agent_endpoint.py

# Deploy using the SDK with the correct endpoint
python3 src/scripts/deploy_agents_sdk.py --endpoint "endpoint-url-from-above"
```

## Running the Application

### Local Execution

To run the application locally without deployment:

```bash
python3 src/scripts/local_chat.py
```

### Testing Weather Service

To test the weather service functionality directly:

```bash
python3 src/scripts/test_weather_direct.py
```

### Interacting with Deployed Agents

After deploying agents (manually or programmatically), interact with them using:

```bash
python3 src/scripts/interact_deployed_agents.py
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter deployment issues:

1. **Authentication Issues**: If you see token expiration errors:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

2. **Resource Not Found**: Verify resource names in `.env` match those in Azure:
   ```bash
   bash src/scripts/list_azure_resources.sh
   ```

3. **API Compatibility**: The Azure AI Agent Service APIs may have changed. Check the [latest documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/azure-ai-agent-service/).

## Next Steps

1. Complete agent deployment through Azure Portal
2. Extend the agents with additional plugins
3. Implement more sophisticated orchestration between agents
4. Add conversation history management

## Conclusion

You have a fully functional multi-agent application that can run locally. The deployment to Azure AI Agent Service can be accomplished through the Azure Portal, while the programmatic deployment options may require adjustments as the Azure AI Agent Service evolves.
