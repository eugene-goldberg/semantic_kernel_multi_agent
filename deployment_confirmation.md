# Deployment Confirmation

## Current Azure OpenAI Deployment Status

We have successfully deployed and validated the multi-agent system to Azure OpenAI with full orchestration capabilities. The current deployment includes:

### Deployed Agents

Total agents deployed: 3

1. **ChatAgent** (ID: asst_Psx1vZD4DDuuuuI2Dwk4OkOL)
   - General purpose conversational agent
   - Handles non-weather questions

2. **WeatherAgent** (ID: asst_qzuXJV5Y3y61iUVpAJn2LU54)
   - Specialized agent for weather information
   - Provides current weather and forecasts

3. **OrchestratorAgent** (ID: asst_5e36ybItgzdgqqO00gsTYIoj)
   - Routes requests to the appropriate specialized agent
   - Analyzes query content to make routing decisions

### Validation Testing

We have confirmed the orchestration capabilities through both non-interactive and interactive testing:

1. **Routing Logic Verification**:
   - Weather queries correctly routed to the WeatherAgent
   - General knowledge queries correctly routed to the ChatAgent
   - Routing decisions include clear explanation of the logic

2. **Weather Functionality**:
   - Successfully retrieves current weather data for US cities
   - Uses hardcoded coordinates to avoid API rate limiting issues

3. **Conversation Capabilities**:
   - Maintains conversational context within sessions
   - Provides natural and informative responses

### Deployment Files

The deployment information is stored in two key files:

1. `deployment_info.json` - Contains individual agent IDs
2. `orchestration_deployment_info.json` - Contains orchestration setup

### Interaction Methods

The deployed system can be interacted with using:

1. **Interactive Chat**:
   ```
   python src/scripts/interact_orchestrated_agents.py
   ```

2. **Non-interactive Testing**:
   ```
   python test_orchestrated_agents.py
   ```

## Conclusion

The deployed multi-agent system is fully operational in Azure OpenAI. All agent types are correctly configured, and the orchestration logic is working as expected. The system successfully demonstrates delegation of specialized tasks to the appropriate agent, providing a seamless user experience.
