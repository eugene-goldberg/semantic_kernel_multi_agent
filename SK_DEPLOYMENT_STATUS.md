# Semantic Kernel Deployment Status

## Current Status

The Semantic Kernel (SK) multi-agent system is now ready for deployment. Here's the current status:

### Local Implementation (COMPLETE)

All agents have been implemented and tested locally:

- Chat Agent: Fully implemented and tested
- Weather Agent: Fully implemented and tested
- Calculator Agent: Fully implemented and tested
- Orchestrator Agent: Fully implemented with proper routing to all specialized agents

### Azure AI Service Setup (IN PROGRESS)

The Azure AI Service setup process has been modified:

- Created documentation for manual setup using Azure AI Studio (recommended)
- The CLI-based setup script encountered issues with the Azure CLI resource types
- Manual creation of resources through Azure AI Studio is now the recommended approach

### Local Testing (COMPLETE)

Local testing has been implemented and verified:

- Created `deploy_local_sk_agents.py` for local agent testing
- Created `test_local_orchestration.py` for orchestration verification
- All agents function correctly in the local environment

### Azure Deployment (PENDING)

The Azure deployment is pending completion of the Azure AI Service setup:

- Deployment scripts are ready but require configured Azure AI Service resources
- Once Azure AI Studio setup is complete, agents can be deployed using `deploy_sk_agents.py`

## Next Steps

1. **Azure AI Studio Setup** (CURRENT TASK):
   - Follow the guidance in `docs/azure_ai_studio_setup.md` to set up Azure AI Service resources
   - Update the `.env.ai_service` file with your Azure subscription information
   - Verify Azure AI Hub and Project are created successfully

2. **Azure Deployment**:
   - After Azure AI Service setup, run `python src/scripts/deploy_sk_agents.py` to deploy all agents
   - Verify deployment success by checking `sk_deployment_info.json`
   - Test interaction with deployed agents using `python src/scripts/interact_sk_agents.py`

3. **Deployment Verification**:
   - Test delegation works correctly with deployed agents
   - Verify orchestration works in the cloud environment
   - Ensure all specialized agents respond correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Azure CLI resource creation:

1. The `aigalleries` resource type may not be available in all regions or may require specific Azure CLI extensions
2. As an alternative, use Azure AI Studio via the Azure Portal to create resources manually
3. Follow the documentation in `docs/azure_ai_studio_setup.md` for step-by-step instructions

## Local Testing Instructions

To test agents locally without Azure deployment:

```bash
# Test all agents
python src/scripts/deploy_local_sk_agents.py

# Test orchestration
python test_local_orchestration.py
```
