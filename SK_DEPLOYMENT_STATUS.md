# Semantic Kernel Deployment Status

## Current Status

The Semantic Kernel (SK) multi-agent system implementation is now complete with two deployment paths: local operation and Azure AI Foundry deployment.

### Local Implementation (COMPLETE)

All agents have been implemented and tested locally:

- Chat Agent: Fully implemented and tested
- Weather Agent: Fully implemented and tested
- Calculator Agent: Fully implemented and tested
- Orchestrator Agent: Fully implemented with proper routing to all specialized agents

### Azure AI Service Initial Approach (DEPRECATED)

The initial Azure AI Service approach faced several challenges:

- Created documentation for manual setup using Azure AI Studio
- The CLI-based setup script encountered issues with the Azure CLI resource types
- Domain resolution issues with Azure AI Service endpoints
- Compatibility issues with the AIProjectClient SDK

### Azure AI Foundry Integration (NEW APPROACH)

Based on the existing deployed agents in Azure AI Foundry, we've created a new implementation:

- Created `ai_foundry_deployment_manager.py` using direct REST API calls
- Added support for Azure AI Foundry workspace configuration
- Implemented complete deployment script for Azure AI Foundry
- Added interactive client for Azure AI Foundry agents
- Applied authentication using Azure CLI tokens

### Local Testing (COMPLETE)

Local testing has been implemented and verified:

- Created `deploy_local_sk_agents.py` for local agent testing
- Created `test_local_orchestration.py` for orchestration verification
- All agents function correctly in the local environment

### Azure AI Foundry Deployment (READY)

The Azure AI Foundry deployment is now ready:

- Added `deploy_ai_foundry_agents.py` for deploying all agents to Azure AI Foundry
- Created `interact_ai_foundry_agents.py` for interacting with deployed agents
- Added full documentation for Azure AI Foundry deployment
- Ready for deployment to existing Azure AI Foundry workspace

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Azure AI Foundry**:
   - Run `python src/scripts/deploy_ai_foundry_agents.py` to deploy all agents
   - Verify deployment success in Azure AI Foundry console
   - Test interaction with `python src/scripts/interact_ai_foundry_agents.py`
   - Verify orchestration works properly with the deployed agents

2. **Enhance Agent Capabilities**:
   - Implement full tool handling in the AI Foundry interaction client
   - Add support for more specialized agents (e.g., image analysis, code generation)
   - Improve error handling and retry logic for better reliability

3. **Documentation and Testing**:
   - Add comprehensive unit tests for deployment scripts
   - Create examples demonstrating complex multi-agent scenarios
   - Update CLAUDE.md with new deployment instructions
   - Create a quickstart guide for new users

## Troubleshooting

### Azure AI Foundry Deployment Issues

1. **Authentication Problems**:
   - Run `az login` to ensure you're authenticated with Azure
   - Verify your account has access to the specified subscription and resource group
   - Check that your account has the Azure AI Developer RBAC role

2. **API Connectivity Issues**:
   - Verify network connectivity to the Azure AI Foundry API endpoint
   - Make sure you're using the correct API version
   - Check the region configuration matches your workspace

3. **Deployment Failures**:
   - Verify the workspace exists and is accessible
   - Confirm that the specified model is available in your region
   - Check logs for specific error messages

### Local Testing Alternative

If you encounter issues with Azure AI Foundry deployment:

1. Use the local testing scripts as an alternative:
   ```bash
   python src/scripts/deploy_local_sk_agents.py
   python test_local_orchestration.py
   ```

2. This allows you to test the functionality of your agents without requiring cloud deployment.

- `docs/azure_ai_studio_setup.md` - Original Azure AI Studio setup guide (deprecated)

## Local Testing Instructions

To test agents locally without Azure deployment:

```bash
# Test all agents
python src/scripts/deploy_local_sk_agents.py

# Test orchestration
python test_local_orchestration.py
```
