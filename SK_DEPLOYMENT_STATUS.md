# Semantic Kernel Deployment Status

## Current Status

The Semantic Kernel (SK) multi-agent system implementation is now complete with API compatibility issues resolved, but there are challenges with actual deployment to Azure AI Service.

### Local Implementation (COMPLETE)

All agents have been implemented and tested locally:

- Chat Agent: Fully implemented and tested
- Weather Agent: Fully implemented and tested
- Calculator Agent: Fully implemented and tested
- Orchestrator Agent: Fully implemented with proper routing to all specialized agents

### Azure AI Service Setup (DONE WITH ISSUES)

The Azure AI Service setup process faced several challenges:

- Created documentation for manual setup using Azure AI Studio (recommended)
- The CLI-based setup script encountered issues with the Azure CLI resource types
- Manual creation of resources through Azure AI Studio was implemented
- Domain resolution issues with Azure AI Service endpoints (westus.ai.projects.azure.com vs. westus.projectsai.azure.com)

### Local Testing (COMPLETE)

Local testing has been implemented and verified:

- Created `deploy_local_sk_agents.py` for local agent testing
- Created `test_local_orchestration.py` for orchestration verification
- All agents function correctly in the local environment

### Azure Deployment (FACING CHALLENGES)

The Azure deployment is facing some technical challenges:

- Updated deployment scripts to use the latest Azure AI Service API
- Fixed compatibility issues with the AIProjectClient
- Encountered domain resolution issues with Azure AI Service endpoints
- Deployed locally for testing but further work needed for cloud deployment

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve Azure AI Service Connectivity Issues**:
   - Verify Azure AI Service endpoint configurations
   - Validate connectivity to Azure AI Service from within the development environment
   - Consider using an Azure VM to eliminate potential connectivity/DNS issues

2. **Alternative Deployment Options**:
   - Focus on local testing with `deploy_local_sk_agents.py` and `test_local_orchestration.py`
   - Consider alternative deployment targets if Azure AI Service connectivity issues persist
   - Explore using Semantic Kernel's OpenAI or Azure OpenAI connectors instead

3. **Complete Local Testing and Documentation**:
   - Run comprehensive local testing of all agents and orchestration
   - Document remaining issues with Azure AI Service deployment
   - Provide workarounds and alternative implementation approaches

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Azure CLI resource creation:

1. The `aigalleries` resource type may not be available in all regions or may require specific Azure CLI extensions
2. As an alternative, use Azure AI Studio via the Azure Portal to create resources manually
3. Follow the documentation in `docs/azure_ai_studio_setup.md` for step-by-step instructions

## Local Testing Instructions

To test agents locally without Azure deployment:

```bash
# Test all agents
python src/scripts/deploy_local_sk_agents.py

# Test orchestration
python test_local_orchestration.py
```
