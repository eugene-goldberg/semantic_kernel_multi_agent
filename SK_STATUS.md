   - Calculator Agent: ✅ Successfully performs mathematical operations

2. **Orchestration Tests**:
   - `test_sk_orchestration.py`: ✅ Verified all agent functionality works correctly
   - `test_sk_orchestration_auto.py`: ✅ Automated verification of all agent types
   - `test_delegation.py`: ✅ Verified correct routing from orchestrator to specialized agents

3. **Interactive Tests**:

   - All agents respond appropriately to both direct and indirect queries

## Deployment Status

The SK-based agents have been implemented and tested locally. The deployment infrastructure has been updated to use Azure AI Service (not Azure OpenAI).

| Deployment Component | Status | Notes |
|----------------------|--------|-------|
| Deployment Script | ✅ Ready | `src/scripts/deploy_sk_agents.py` is ready for execution |
| Deployment Manager | ✅ Updated | `src/utils/sk_deployment_manager.py` updated to use Azure AI Service |
| Agent Configurations | ✅ Ready | All agent configurations are properly set in `src/config/agent_configs.py` |
| Azure Environment Setup | ✅ Ready | `src/scripts/setup_azure_ai_service.sh` script created to set up Azure AI Service resources |
| Client Interaction | ✅ Updated | `src/scripts/interact_sk_agents.py` updated to work with Azure AI Service |
| Actual Deployment | ⚠️ Pending | Deployment to Azure AI Service has not been executed yet |

## Next Steps

1. **Azure AI Service Setup** (NEXT PRIORITY):
   - Run `./src/scripts/setup_azure_ai_service.sh` to set up Azure AI Service resources
   - Verify Azure AI Hub and Project are created successfully
   - Check that environment variables are properly configured

2. **Azure Deployment**:
   - Run `python src/scripts/deploy_sk_agents.py` to deploy all SK-based agents to Azure AI Service
   - Verify deployment was successful by checking `sk_deployment_info.json`
   - Test interaction with deployed agents using `python src/scripts/interact_sk_agents.py`

2. **Deployment Verification**:
   - Test delegation works correctly with deployed agents
   - Verify orchestration works in the cloud environment
   - Ensure all specialized agents respond correctly

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update documentation with Azure deployment details
   - Create deployment verification document
   - Ensure all documentation reflects the SK-based implementation

## Implementation Details

### Azure AI Service Integration

The implementation has been updated to use Azure AI Service (not Azure OpenAI) with the following key components:

1. **Azure AI Project Client**:
   ```python
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
   
   # Create client using connection string
   credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
   client = AIProjectClient.from_connection_string(
       connection_string=connection_string,
       credential=credential
   )
   ```

2. **Agent Deployment**:
   ```python
   # Deploy agent to Azure AI Service
   agent_definition = await client.agents.create_agent(
       model=model,
       name=name,
       instructions=instructions,
       tools=tools if tools else None
   )
   ```

3. **Interaction with Agents**:
   ```python
   # Create thread
   thread = await client.agents.create_thread()
   
   # Add message to thread
   await client.agents.create_message(
       thread_id=thread_id,
       role="user",
       content=message
   )
   
   # Run agent on thread
   run = await client.agents.create_run(
       thread_id=thread_id,
       agent_id=agent_id
   )
   ```

4. **Function Calling**:
   - Implemented via tool definitions in agent deployment
   - Tools configured for Weather and Calculator functionality

### Orchestration Pattern

The SK-based orchestration follows this pattern:

1. User query is sent to the Orchestrator Agent
2. Orchestrator analyzes the content to determine the appropriate agent
3. Query is routed to the specialized agent (Chat, Weather, or Calculator)
4. Specialized agent processes the request using its plugins if needed
5. Response is returned to the user

This approach offers:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Extensibility with additional specialized agents
- Consistent interface across all agent types

## Compatibility Notes

- The implementation is compatible with Semantic Kernel SDK version 1.30.0
- Uses Azure OpenAI API version "2024-02-15-preview"
- Requires Azure AI Service resources for deployment
- All agents use the same model (specified in deployment environment)

## Git Status

The current SK implementation has been committed to the repository:

- Branch: main
- Last commit: "Implement Azure AI Service deployment for SK agents"
- Key changes:
  - Updated deployment manager to use Azure AI Service
  - Created setup script for Azure AI environment
  - Updated interaction client
  - Added documentation for Azure AI Service deployment

## Troubleshooting

If issues arise during deployment:

1. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Run `az login` to ensure you're authenticated with Azure
   - Verify DefaultAzureCredential can access your subscription
   - Check that you have appropriate permissions for Azure AI Service

2. **Deployment Failures**:
   - Check Azure resource quotas and limits
   - Ensure the model specified in configuration is available
   - Review logs for specific error messages

3. **Agent Functionality Issues**:
   - Test agents locally first with test_sk_orchestration.py
   - Verify plugin registration in the agent code
   - Check service configuration in agent_factory.py

## Conclusion

The Semantic Kernel-based multi-agent system is fully implemented and tested locally. All components are working correctly with proper orchestration and delegation. The deployment infrastructure has been completely updated to use Azure AI Service instead of Azure OpenAI, with dedicated setup scripts and interaction clients.

The implementation is now ready for actual deployment to Azure AI Service, with the first step being to run the setup script to create the necessary Azure resources.
