# Technical Details of Successful Deployment

## Azure Resources Structure

```
Resource Group: semantic-kernel-multi-agent-rg
├── OpenAI Account: sk-multi-agent-openai
│   └── Deployment: gpt-35-turbo (version: 0125)
├── ML Workspace (Hub): sk-multi-agent-hub
└── ML Workspace (Project): sk-multi-agent-project
    └── Connection: skmultiagentopenai (to OpenAI account)
```

## OpenAI Deployment Capabilities

The `gpt-35-turbo` deployment has the following capabilities:
```json
"capabilities": {
  "assistants": "true", 
  "chatCompletion": "true",
  "maxContextToken": "16385",
  "maxOutputToken": "4096"
}
```

The crucial finding was that the deployment has `"assistants": "true"` capability.

## API Version Requirements

The Azure OpenAI Assistants API is only available in the following API versions:
- 2024-03-01-preview
- 2024-04-01-preview 
- 2024-05-01-preview

Earlier versions (2023-07-01-preview, 2023-09-15-preview, etc.) do not support the Assistants API.

## Endpoint Structure

The correct endpoint for the Assistants API is the Azure OpenAI endpoint:
```
https://sk-multi-agent-openai.openai.azure.com/
```

## Authentication

For the Azure OpenAI Assistants API, the authentication is simple API key authentication:
```python
client = AzureOpenAI(
    azure_endpoint=AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT,
    api_key=AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY,
    api_version="2024-05-01-preview"
)
```

## Deployment Process

The deployment script uses the following key steps:

1. Create an OpenAI client with the correct API version:
   ```python
   client = AzureOpenAI(
       azure_endpoint=AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT,
       api_key=AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY,
       api_version="2024-05-01-preview"
   )
   ```

2. Create the Chat Agent:
   ```python
   chat_agent = client.beta.assistants.create(
       name="ChatAgent",
       instructions="You are a helpful assistant that provides friendly, concise, and accurate information...",
       model=AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME,
       tools=[]
   )
   ```

3. Create the Weather Agent:
   ```python
   weather_agent = client.beta.assistants.create(
       name="WeatherAgent",
       instructions="You are a weather specialist agent that provides accurate and helpful weather information...",
       model=AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME,
       tools=[]
   )
   ```

4. Save deployment information:
   ```python
   deployment_info = {
       "chat_agent_id": chat_agent.id,
       "weather_agent_id": weather_agent.id,
       "project_host": AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT.replace("https://", "").replace("/", ""),
       "project_name": "azure-openai-assistants"
   }
   ```

## Interaction Process

The interaction script uses the following key steps:

1. Create a thread for conversation:
   ```python
   thread = client.beta.threads.create()
   ```

2. Add a user message to the thread:
   ```python
   message = client.beta.threads.messages.create(
       thread_id=thread_id,
       role="user",
       content=message_text
   )
   ```

3. Run the assistant on the thread:
   ```python
   run = client.beta.threads.runs.create(
       thread_id=thread_id,
       assistant_id=agent_id
   )
   ```

4. Poll for completion:
   ```python
   while True:
       run_status = client.beta.threads.runs.retrieve(
           thread_id=thread_id,
           run_id=run.id
       )
       if run_status.status in ["completed", "failed", "cancelled"]:
           break
       time.sleep(1)
   ```

5. Get the messages from the thread:
   ```python
   messages = client.beta.threads.messages.list(
       thread_id=thread_id
   )
   ```

## Final Agent IDs

The deployment resulted in the following agent IDs:
- Chat Agent: `asst_mlM7d4ziChBc3AeTpP10YQPI`
- Weather Agent: `asst_qGrjdsmtfytNnYMli4vYAn2p`

## Failed Approaches

1. **Azure AI Agent Service SDK**: Failed due to endpoint and authentication issues.
2. **Azure CLI REST API**: Failed due to incorrect resource type targeting.
3. **Older API versions**: Failed with 404 errors when trying to access Assistants API.

## Debugging Techniques Used

1. **API Version Testing**: Created a script to test different API versions and capabilities.
2. **Azure Resource Examination**: Used Azure CLI to list and examine all resources.
3. **Capability Verification**: Checked deployment capabilities to confirm assistants feature.
4. **Error Analysis**: Analyzed 404 errors to determine the correct endpoints and API versions.

## Complete Code Files

The successful deployment is implemented in these files:

1. `src/scripts/deploy_openai_assistants.py` - Deploys the agents
2. `src/scripts/interact_openai_assistants.py` - Interacts with the agents 
3. `src/scripts/check_api_versions.py` - Discovers compatible API versions
