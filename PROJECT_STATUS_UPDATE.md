# Project Status Update: Semantic Kernel Multi-Agent Application

## Deployment Status

1. **Successfully Deployed Agents**
   - Deployed Chat Agent to Azure OpenAI (ID: asst_lWbLSlRiI08tPv1AUMY76OhC)
   - Deployed Weather Agent to Azure OpenAI (ID: asst_z7oRxeHlfi9xrK9SAeSsUcSq)
   - Used Azure OpenAI Assistants API with gpt-35-turbo model
   - Used API version 2024-02-15-preview for compatibility

2. **Deployment Achievements**
   - Created reliable deployment script (deploy_openai_assistants.py)
   - Implemented proper authentication with API keys
   - Successfully saved deployment information for future reference
   - Verified agents are accessible and responsive

3. **Testing Status**
   - Successfully tested individual agent functionality
   - Successfully tested interaction with deployed agents
   - Working on local orchestration testing with Semantic Kernel 1.30.0
   - Encountered API compatibility issues with orchestration code

## Current Challenges

1. **Semantic Kernel API Compatibility**
   - Original orchestration code uses outdated API methods not available in SK 1.30.0
   - Need to update code to match current Semantic Kernel API
   - Working on fixing `complete_chat_async` method references

2. **Weather Service Issues**
   - Experiencing 403 Forbidden errors from OpenStreetMap Nominatim geocoding service
   - Need to resolve geocoding issues for weather service functionality
   - Weather plugin core functionality works but depends on geocoding

3. **Interactive Testing Environment**
   - Non-interactive tests are more reliable in current environment
   - Working on adapting test scripts for better compatibility

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Semantic Kernel API Compatibility**
   - Update orchestration code to use current SK 1.30.0 API
   - Replace deprecated method calls with current implementations
   - Update function calling patterns to match current SDK

2. **Resolve Weather Service Issues**
   - Find alternative approach for geocoding that doesn't hit rate limits
   - Ensure weather plugin works reliably in orchestration scenarios

3. **Complete Orchestration Testing**
   - Finish implementation of local orchestration testing
   - Verify proper function calling between agents
   - Document orchestration patterns and best practices

## Overall Project Health

The project has achieved its primary deployment goals. The agents are successfully deployed to Azure OpenAI and can be interacted with using the provided scripts. We're now working on the local orchestration component to enable proper multi-agent interaction through Semantic Kernel. The remaining issues are well-understood and have clear paths to resolution.
