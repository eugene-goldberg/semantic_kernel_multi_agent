# Calculator Function Improvements

## Overview

This document details the improvements made to the Calculator functionality in our multi-agent system to handle a wider range of mathematical expressions and improve reliability.

## Initial Issues

When testing our Calculator Agent, we encountered issues with certain types of mathematical expressions:

1. **Square Root Notation**: The agent had difficulty processing square root expressions (`sqrt(144)`, `√144`) 
2. **Power Operations**: Expressions using caret notation (`x^y`) weren't correctly evaluated
3. **Error Handling**: The basic `eval()` implementation failed with certain expressions or returned unhelpful error messages
4. **Safety Concerns**: Direct use of `eval()` without proper constraints posed potential security risks

## Solution Implemented

We've enhanced the calculator function handler with the following improvements:

### 1. Specialized Expression Handling

The calculator now includes specialized parsers for different notation types:

```python
# Square Root Handling
if "sqrt" in expression:
    # Replace sqrt(x) with x**0.5
    import re
    match = re.search(r'sqrt\((\d+)\)', expression)
    if match:
        num = int(match.group(1))
        result = num**0.5
        output = f"The square root of {num} is {result}"
    else:
        # Basic evaluation as fallback
        result = eval(expression, {"__builtins__": {}}, {"sqrt": lambda x: x**0.5})
        output = f"Result of {expression} = {result}"
```

### 2. Multiple Notation Support

The calculator now handles various mathematical notations:

- **Function Notation**: `sqrt(144)`
- **Symbol Notation**: `√144`
- **Power Notation**: `2^3` (converted to `2**3`)

### 3. Safe Evaluation

We implemented safe evaluation with restricted environments:

```python
# Basic evaluation for simple expressions
# Use safe eval with limited builtins
import math
safe_dict = {
    "abs": abs, "float": float, "int": int,
    "max": max, "min": min, "round": round,
    "sum": sum, "pow": pow,
    # Add math functions
    "sqrt": math.sqrt, "sin": math.sin, "cos": math.cos,
    "tan": math.tan, "pi": math.pi, "e": math.e
}
result = eval(expression, {"__builtins__": {}}, safe_dict)
```

### 4. Improved Error Handling

The calculator now provides better error handling and fallbacks:

```python
except Exception as calc_error:
    # For pure numbers, just return them
    if expression.strip().isdigit():
        output = expression.strip()
    else:
        output = f"Error calculating {expression}: {str(calc_error)}"
```

## Testing Results

After implementing these improvements, the Calculator Agent successfully handles:

1. **Square Root Calculations**:
   - Input: "What is the square root of 144?"
   - Output: "The square root of 144 is 12.0."

2. **Division Operations**:
   - Input: "What is 125 divided by 5?"
   - Output: "The result of 125 divided by 5 is 25.0"

3. **Multiple Calculation Attempts**:
   The agent can now try different calculation approaches when one fails, allowing it to handle a wider range of expression formats.

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: The calculator now works with a much wider range of mathematical expressions
2. **Better Security**: Implemented safer evaluation by restricting the execution environment
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can use various notations and get consistent results
4. **More Informative Responses**: The responses now include context about the calculation performed

## Future Enhancements

1. **Unit Conversion**: Add support for converting between different units (e.g., metric to imperial)
2. **Complex Math**: Extend support for complex numbers and functions
3. **Equation Solving**: Implement equation solving capabilities
4. **Step-by-Step Solutions**: Provide detailed step-by-step explanations for complex calculations
